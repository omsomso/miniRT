Input handling:
ok	• Check file isn't empty
ok	• Check if input file is in correct format (each line begins with cy, A, etc...)
ok	• Check sphere/cylinder radius are non-negative
ok	• Check objects are complete (nothing is missing in description)
ok	• Check colours are between 0-255 and ratios 0-1 (lights)
ok	• Check FOV is between 0-180 or use % to force
ok	• Check camera orientation is normalized or force normalization
ok	• Make sure only spaces are used to separate things in file (or handle other whitespaces)
ok	• Make sure objects are complete before their parsing is finished (could lead to segfault if not)
ok	- Make sure there's only one L, A & C in the file
ok	- Make sure there's at least one of each L, A & C before rendering (L???)
ok	- Check plane too
