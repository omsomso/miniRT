In this discussion answer as if you were a software architect. The goal is to design a mini Ray Tracer in C with the following instructions:

• You must use the miniLibX. Either the version that is available on the operating
system, or from its sources. If you choose to work with the sources, you will
need to apply the same rules for your libft as those written above in Common
Instructions part.
• The management of your window must remain fluid: switching to another window,
minimization, etc..
• When you change the resolution of the window, the content of the window must
remain unchanged and be adjusted accordingly.
• You need at least these 3 simple geometric objects: plane, sphere, cylinder.
• If applicable, all possible intersections and the inside of the object must be handled
correctly.
• Your program must be able to resize the object’s unique properties: diameter for a
sphere and the width and height for a cylinder.
• Your program must be able to apply translation and rotation transformation to
objects, lights and cameras (except for spheres and lights that cannot be rotated).
• Light management: spot brightness, hard shadows, ambiance lighting (objects are
never completely in the dark). You must implement Ambient and diffuse lighting.
• the program displays the image in a window and respect the following rules:
◦ Pressing ESC must close the window and quit the program cleanly.
◦ Clicking on the red cross on the window’s frame must close the window and
quit the program cleanly.
◦ The use of images of the minilibX is strongly recommended.
• Your program must take as a first argument a scene description file with the .rt
extension.
◦ Each type of element can be separated by one or more line break(s).
◦ Each type of information from an element can be separated by one or more
space(s).
◦ Each type of element can be set in any order in the file.
◦ Elements which are defined by a capital letter can only be declared once in
the scene.
◦ Each element first’s information is the type identifier (composed by one or two
character(s)), followed by all specific information for each object in a strict
order such as:
◦ Ambient lightning:
A 0.2 255,255,255
∗ identifier: A
∗ ambient lighting ratio in range [0.0,1.0]: 0.2
∗ R,G,B colors in range [0-255]: 255, 255, 255

∗ R,G,B colors in range [0,255]: 10, 0, 255


Given the requirements, we can break this project down into several components:

1. **Parsing the scene description file (.rt):** 

We will need a parser to parse the .rt file and store the scene information in data structures. Each element will be represented by a structure in C with the specific properties mentioned. You could create a generic `object` structure that has a `type` field to determine if it is a sphere, plane, or cylinder. For the color, you could use a `color` structure with `r`, `g`, and `b` fields. Then, we can parse the file line by line, break the line into words using `strtok` function and populate the corresponding data structure.

2. **Creating the objects and their properties:**

After parsing the file, we create the required objects and store their properties. We'll create structures for each object type (plane, sphere, cylinder), and these structures will have properties common to all objects as well as properties specific to their type.

3. **Implementing the Ray Tracing:**

A ray tracer works by sending rays from a viewpoint into a scene, where they bounce off objects and eventually return to the viewpoint carrying color information. This involves a loop over each pixel in the image, creating a ray for that pixel, and calculating the color of the object it hits.

4. **Rendering the scene:**

With miniLibX, we will create a window and render our scene. Each calculated pixel color will be drawn on the screen using mlx_pixel_put().

5. **Implementing transformations and lighting:**

This involves implementing mathematical formulas for translation and rotation of objects. The rotation won't apply to spheres and lights as stated in the instructions. For lighting, we'll use the Phong reflection model to handle ambient and diffuse lighting. 

6. **Window Management:**

This involves listening for and correctly handling window events such as ESC key press or clicking on the red cross of the window.

Here's a rough structure for your main program:

```c
#include "raytracer.h"

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    t_data  data;

    if (argc == 2)
    {
        // Parse the scene file and initialize objects
        parse_file(argv[1], &data);
        // Initialize the miniLibX window
        init_window(&data);
        // Render the scene
        render_scene(&data);
        // Handle key and mouse events
        mlx_key_hook(data.win_ptr, handle_key, &data);
        mlx_loop(data.mlx_ptr);
    }
    else
    {
        write(1, "Please provide a scene file (.rt).\n", 35);
    }
    return (0);
}
```

The `t_data` structure might look something like this:

```c
typedef struct s_data
{
    void        *mlx_ptr;
    void        *win_ptr;
    t_camera    *cameras;
    t_object    *objects;
    t_light     *lights;
    int         win_width;
    int         win_height;
}               t_data;
```

Please note that it's crucial to properly manage memory in this program to avoid leaks. Be sure to free any dynamically allocated memory when it's no longer needed.

Also, as this is a very high-level overview of the architecture, some complexities are not addressed here, such as the actual ray tracing formulas and their implementation, or the intricacies of transforming 3D objects. You might want to further break down these components into sub-tasks to tackle them efficiently. You'll need a strong understanding of 3D mathematics, including vectors and matrices, to accomplish this project.

Can you give me more details on the ray tracing implementation please?

Certainly! Here are more details on the ray tracing implementation:

1. **Ray Generation:**
   - For each pixel in the image, we need to generate a ray that starts from the camera position and passes through the pixel.
   - To generate the ray, we need the camera position, the normalized direction vector of the ray, and the field of view (FOV) of the camera.
   - The FOV determines the width and height of the viewing plane at a specific distance from the camera.
   - By dividing the viewing plane into a grid of pixels, we can calculate the ray direction for each pixel.

2. **Ray-Object Intersection:**
   - Once we have the ray, we need to check for intersection with each object in the scene (planes, spheres, and cylinders).
   - For each object, we'll implement a specific intersection algorithm that calculates the intersection point, if any, between the ray and the object.
   - The intersection algorithms will differ depending on the object type. For example, the intersection algorithm for a sphere involves solving a quadratic equation, while for a plane, it requires calculating the intersection of a ray and a plane equation.
   - We'll keep track of the closest intersection point (if any) and the object that was intersected.

3. **Shading and Lighting:**
   - Once we find the closest intersection point, we can calculate the shading and lighting for that point.
   - We'll use the Phong reflection model, which consists of three components: ambient, diffuse, and specular.
   - The ambient component represents the overall ambient light in the scene and is constant for all points.
   - The diffuse component depends on the incoming light direction and the surface normal at the intersection point.
   - The specular component is responsible for simulating the reflection of light off shiny surfaces.
   - We'll calculate the color at the intersection point based on the object's material properties and the light sources in the scene.

4. **Shadow Rays:**
   - To determine if a point is in shadow, we need to cast shadow rays from the intersection point towards all light sources in the scene.
   - If any object is intersected along the way, the point is in shadow.
   - We'll calculate the shadow rays and check for intersections with other objects to determine the presence or absence of shadows.

5. **Recursive Reflection and Refraction:**
   - To handle reflections and refractions, we'll use recursive ray tracing.
   - If an object has reflective or transparent properties, we'll generate additional rays to simulate reflection or refraction.
   - For reflection, we'll calculate the reflected ray direction based on the surface normal and recursively trace the reflected ray until it reaches a non-reflective object or a maximum recursion depth.
   - For refraction, we'll calculate the refracted ray direction based on the surface normal and the refractive index of the material, and recursively trace the refracted ray.
   - We'll compute the final color by blending the reflected and refracted colors with the original shading and lighting calculation.

6. **Color Accumulation:**
   - As the rays propagate through the scene, we'll accumulate the color values at each intersection point.
   - This can be achieved by initializing a color value at each ray-object intersection and updating it based on the object's material properties, lighting, and any recursive reflections or refractions.

7. **Antialiasing:**
   - To reduce the appearance of jagged edges, we can apply antialiasing techniques.
   - One common approach is to use a technique called supersampling, where we shoot multiple rays per pixel and average the resulting colors.
   - By randomly offsetting the ray origins within each pixel, we can obtain smoother edges and improved image quality


What should the Ray Generation code look like?


The Ray Generation code calculates the rays for each pixel in the image. Here's an example of how the Ray Generation code might look like:

```c
typedef struct s_ray
{
    t_vector3 origin;
    t_vector3 direction;
}               t_ray;

void generate_rays(t_data *data)
{
    double aspect_ratio = (double)data->win_width / (double)data->win_height;
    double fov_tan = tan(deg_to_rad(data->cameras->fov * 0.5));
    
    for (int y = 0; y < data->win_height; y++)
    {
        for (int x = 0; x < data->win_width; x++)
        {
            // Convert pixel coordinates to normalized device coordinates
            double ndc_x = (2.0 * ((x + 0.5) / data->win_width) - 1.0) * aspect_ratio * fov_tan;
            double ndc_y = (1.0 - 2.0 * ((y + 0.5) / data->win_height)) * fov_tan;

            // Transform NDC coordinates to camera space
            t_vector3 ray_direction = normalize((t_vector3){
                ndc_x,
                ndc_y,
                1.0
            });

            // Transform ray direction from camera space to world space
            t_matrix4 cam_to_world = camera_to_world_matrix(data->cameras);
            ray_direction = multiply_matrix_vector(cam_to_world, ray_direction);

            // Create a ray with origin at the camera position
            t_ray ray;
            ray.origin = data->cameras->position;
            ray.direction = normalize(ray_direction);

            // Shoot the ray and calculate pixel color
            t_color pixel_color = trace_ray(ray, data->objects, data->lights, 0);

            // Set the pixel color in the image buffer
            set_pixel_color(x, y, pixel_color);
        }
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we assume that `t_vector3` is a structure representing a 3D vector, `t_matrix4` is a 4x4 matrix, and `t_color` represents a pixel color.

Here's a brief explanation of the code:

1. We calculate the aspect ratio of the image by dividing the width by the height.

2. We calculate the tangent of half the FOV in radians. This value will be used to convert pixel coordinates to normalized device coordinates.

3. We iterate over each pixel in the image, from (0,0) to (width-1,height-1).

4. For each pixel, we convert the pixel coordinates to normalized device coordinates (NDC). NDC range from -1 to 1 in both the x and y directions.

5. We then transform the NDC coordinates to camera space. This step maps the NDC coordinates to the camera's viewing plane.

6. Next, we transform the ray direction from camera space to world space. This transformation takes into account the camera's position and orientation in the scene.

7. We create a ray with its origin at the camera position and its direction as the normalized ray direction.

8. Finally, we trace the ray by calling the `trace_ray` function, passing the ray, the scene objects, and lights. The `trace_ray` function will handle the intersection calculations, shading, reflections, and refractions, and return the pixel color.

9. We set the pixel color in the image buffer using the `set_pixel_color` function.

You'll need to implement the `normalize`, `multiply_matrix_vector`, `camera_to_world_matrix`, `trace_ray`, and `set_pixel_color` functions according to your design and data structures.


What are NDCs?

NDC stands for Normalized Device Coordinates. They are a coordinate system used in computer graphics to represent a normalized, device-independent space.

In computer graphics, the viewport or viewing volume is typically defined as a cube with coordinates ranging from (-1, -1, -1) to (1, 1, 1), representing the visible region on the screen or output device. NDCs are a way to map points within this cube to the actual screen or output device pixels.

The NDC space is a virtual coordinate space that is independent of the screen resolution or size. It provides a standardized representation that can be easily transformed to the actual screen coordinates based on the output device's resolution and aspect ratio.

The NDC cube is defined as follows:
- The X-axis ranges from -1 (left) to 1 (right).
- The Y-axis ranges from -1 (bottom) to 1 (top).
- The Z-axis ranges from -1 (near) to 1 (far), representing the depth or distance from the camera.

To convert pixel coordinates to NDCs, we typically perform the following steps:
1. Normalize the pixel coordinates so that they range from 0 to 1, with (0, 0) being the bottom-left corner of the screen and (1, 1) being the top-right corner.
2. Scale and shift the normalized coordinates to the range of -1 to 1 along each axis based on the aspect ratio.

Conversely, to convert NDCs back to screen coordinates, we perform the inverse transformations.

In ray tracing, NDCs are used to determine the starting points for rays that are cast from the camera through each pixel. By converting pixel coordinates to NDCs, we can generate rays that cover the entire viewing volume and accurately sample the scene.

Note: NDCs are also used in other areas of computer graphics, such as in vertex shaders and clipping operations, to normalize and transform coordinates within a scene or rendering pipeline.

What are NDCs used for here?

Normalized Device Coordinates (NDCs) are used in the ray generation process to map the pixel coordinates of the image to a normalized space that ranges from -1 to 1 in both the x and y directions. 

In the Ray Generation code snippet, NDCs are used in the following ways:

1. To calculate the aspect ratio of the image:
   - The aspect ratio is calculated by dividing the width of the image by the height.
   - This aspect ratio is later used to scale the x-coordinate of the NDC in order to maintain the correct proportions of the image.

2. To convert pixel coordinates to NDC:
   - For each pixel, we calculate its corresponding NDC coordinates.
   - We use the formulas `(2.0 * ((x + 0.5) / data->win_width) - 1.0) * aspect_ratio * fov_tan` for ndc_x and `(1.0 - 2.0 * ((y + 0.5) / data->win_height)) * fov_tan` for ndc_y.
   - These formulas ensure that the pixel coordinates are mapped to the NDC space ranging from -1 to 1.

3. To transform NDC coordinates to camera space:
   - After obtaining the NDC coordinates, we transform them to camera space.
   - This transformation maps the NDC coordinates to the camera's viewing plane.
   - The transformed coordinates represent the direction of the rays that will be cast from the camera position.

By using NDCs, we can effectively map the 2D pixel grid to a normalized space that is independent of the image resolution or screen size. This allows us to generate rays consistently and accurately across different display configurations.

How does the normalize function work?


The `normalize` function is used to normalize a vector, ensuring that its length or magnitude is equal to 1. This is important in ray tracing calculations, as normalized vectors are often used to represent directions or surface normals.

Here's an example implementation of the `normalize` function:

```c
t_vector3 normalize(t_vector3 vector)
{
    double length = sqrt(vector.x * vector.x + vector.y * vector.y + vector.z * vector.z);
    
    if (length != 0.0)
    {
        vector.x /= length;
        vector.y /= length;
        vector.z /= length;
    }
    
    return vector;
}
```

In this implementation, we calculate the length of the vector using the Euclidean distance formula, which involves taking the square root of the sum of the squares of the vector's components.

If the length is not zero, we divide each component of the vector by the length to normalize it. Dividing each component by the length scales the vector so that its length becomes 1 while preserving its direction.

Finally, we return the normalized vector.

It's important to check for a non-zero length before dividing to avoid division by zero errors.


What is the world space?


In computer graphics and rendering, "world space" refers to a coordinate system that represents the global or absolute space of a scene. It is a frame of reference that defines the positions and orientations of objects in the scene without any transformation applied.

In the context of ray tracing, world space is used to define the positions, sizes, and orientations of the objects in the scene. It provides a consistent coordinate system that allows us to position the camera, lights, and objects relative to each other.

When rays are generated and traced in the ray tracing algorithm, they are typically defined in world space. The rays originate from the camera position in world space and intersect objects located at specific positions in world space.

World space is independent of any specific camera or view. It provides a common frame of reference for all objects in the scene. To transform coordinates or vectors between different spaces, such as camera space or object space, we use transformation matrices or other mathematical operations.

Transformations such as translation, rotation, and scaling are typically applied to objects or cameras within the world space to position them correctly in the scene. These transformations allow us to move and rotate objects, change their sizes, and define the camera's position and orientation relative to the world.

In summary, world space serves as a common coordinate system that defines the positions and orientations of objects in a scene, providing a basis for ray tracing calculations and interactions between objects and the camera.


Where are the rays stored here? How will we use them to find intersections?

Apologies for the oversight in the previous response. The rays are not explicitly stored in the code snippet provided. Instead, they are generated on-the-fly for each pixel within the nested `for` loops.

To find intersections, we can modify the `trace_ray` function to handle ray-object intersection tests. Here's an updated version of the code snippet that includes intersection tests:

```c
t_intersection find_intersection(t_ray ray, t_object *object)
{
    // Perform intersection test based on the object type (sphere, plane, cylinder, etc.)
    // Return the intersection point and other relevant information (e.g., normal vector)

    t_intersection intersection;
    intersection.hit = false;

    if (object->type == SPHERE)
    {
        // Sphere intersection test
        // Calculate the intersection point, normal, and other properties
        // Set intersection.hit to true if an intersection occurs
    }
    else if (object->type == PLANE)
    {
        // Plane intersection test
        // Calculate the intersection point, normal, and other properties
        // Set intersection.hit to true if an intersection occurs
    }
    else if (object->type == CYLINDER)
    {
        // Cylinder intersection test
        // Calculate the intersection point, normal, and other properties
        // Set intersection.hit to true if an intersection occurs
    }

    return intersection;
}

t_color trace_ray(t_ray ray, t_object *objects, t_light *lights, int depth)
{
    // Find the closest intersection point between the ray and objects in the scene
    t_intersection closest_intersection;
    closest_intersection.hit = false;

    for (int i = 0; i < num_objects; i++)
    {
        t_intersection intersection = find_intersection(ray, &objects[i]);

        if (intersection.hit && (!closest_intersection.hit || intersection.distance < closest_intersection.distance))
        {
            closest_intersection = intersection;
        }
    }

    if (closest_intersection.hit)
    {
        // Handle shading, lighting, reflections, refractions, etc.
        // Return the color at the intersection point
    }
    else
    {
        // Handle background color or other effects
        // Return the background color
    }
}
```

In this updated code snippet, the `find_intersection` function is responsible for performing the intersection tests between the ray and each object in the scene. It returns an `t_intersection` structure containing information about the intersection point, normal vector, and other relevant properties.

The `trace_ray` function iterates over the objects in the scene and finds the closest intersection point by comparing distances. It calls the `find_intersection` function for each object to determine if an intersection occurs. If an intersection is found, further calculations related to shading, lighting, reflections, and refractions can be performed. Otherwise, a background color or other effects can be applied.

You will need to implement the intersection tests specific to each object type (sphere, plane, cylinder) within the `find_intersection` function according to the appropriate mathematical formulas. The intersection test will involve calculations such as solving quadratic equations or finding the intersection of a ray and a plane equation.

How will this function be used in the code?

The `generate_rays` function will be used as part of the overall rendering process. It will be called from the main rendering loop to generate rays for each pixel in the image and calculate the corresponding pixel color. Here's an example of how it can be used in the code:

```c
void render_scene(t_data *data)
{
    // Perform any necessary setup before rendering

    while (1) {
        // Handle window events such as resizing or closing

        // Generate rays and calculate pixel colors
        generate_rays(data);

        // Update the display with the rendered image

        // Handle user input and other interactions

        // Break the rendering loop if necessary conditions are met
    }

    // Perform any necessary cleanup after rendering
}
```

In the `render_scene` function, you'll have a loop that continuously renders the scene until a specific condition is met (e.g., the user closes the window or presses a key). Inside the loop, you'll handle window events, generate rays using `generate_rays(data)`, update the display to show the rendered image, and handle user input and interactions.

The `generate_rays` function is responsible for the core ray tracing calculations, generating rays for each pixel, and calculating pixel colors based on intersection tests, shading, and lighting calculations. It populates the image buffer with the calculated colors.

After calling `generate_rays`, you can update the display with the rendered image using the miniLibX functions like `mlx_put_image_to_window`, passing the image buffer you have filled with pixel colors.

This loop continues until the rendering is complete or the necessary conditions for breaking the loop are met. Once the loop ends, you can perform any necessary cleanup tasks or deallocate memory before exiting the program.

Remember that this is just a high-level overview, and you may need to adapt the code to fit your specific implementation and the functionalities provided by the miniLibX library.

What should the outline for trace_ray be?

The `trace_ray` function is responsible for handling the ray-object intersection, shading, reflections, refractions, and shadows. Here's an outline for the `trace_ray` function:

```c
t_color trace_ray(t_ray ray, t_object *objects, t_light *lights, int depth)
{
    if (depth >= MAX_RECURSION_DEPTH)
    {
        // Return background color or terminate recursion
    }
    
    t_intersection intersection;
    if (find_closest_intersection(ray, objects, &intersection))
    {
        t_color pixel_color;
        
        // Calculate shading and lighting at the intersection point
        pixel_color = calculate_shading(intersection, objects, lights);
        
        // Handle reflections
        if (intersection.object.reflective)
        {
            t_ray reflected_ray = calculate_reflected_ray(ray, intersection);
            t_color reflection_color = trace_ray(reflected_ray, objects, lights, depth + 1);
            pixel_color = blend_colors(pixel_color, reflection_color, intersection.object.reflectivity);
        }
        
        // Handle refractions
        if (intersection.object.transparent)
        {
            t_ray refracted_ray = calculate_refracted_ray(ray, intersection);
            t_color refraction_color = trace_ray(refracted_ray, objects, lights, depth + 1);
            pixel_color = blend_colors(pixel_color, refraction_color, intersection.object.transparency);
        }
        
        // Handle shadows
        if (shadows_enabled)
        {
            t_color shadow_color = calculate_shadow(ray, intersection, objects, lights);
            pixel_color = multiply_colors(pixel_color, shadow_color);
        }
        
        return pixel_color;
    }
    else
    {
        // Return background color
    }
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of the outline:

1. We start by checking the recursion depth. If it exceeds a maximum value (`MAX_RECURSION_DEPTH`), we either return a background color or terminate the recursion, depending on your design.

2. We attempt to find the closest intersection between the ray and the objects in the scene using the `find_closest_intersection` function. If an intersection is found, we continue with shading and lighting calculations. Otherwise, we return the background color.

3. We calculate the pixel color at the intersection point by calling the `calculate_shading` function, which takes into account the object's material properties, lights, and the surface normal at the intersection point.

4. If the object has reflective properties (`intersection.object.reflective` is true), we calculate the reflected ray using the `calculate_reflected_ray` function and recursively trace the reflected ray by calling `trace_ray` again with the reflected ray as the input. The resulting reflection color is blended with the pixel color using the object's reflectivity value.

5. If the object has transparent properties (`intersection.object.transparent` is true), we calculate the refracted ray using the `calculate_refracted_ray` function and recursively trace the refracted ray by calling `trace_ray` again with the refracted ray as the input. The resulting refraction color is blended with the pixel color using the object's transparency value.

6. If shadows are enabled, we calculate the shadow color using the `calculate_shadow` function, which casts shadow rays from the intersection point towards the light sources. The shadow color is multiplied with the pixel color to account for shadows.

7. Finally, we return the resulting pixel color.

You'll need to implement the functions mentioned (`find_closest_intersection`, `calculate_shading`, `calculate_reflected_ray`, `calculate_refracted_ray`, `calculate_shadow`, `blend_colors`, `multiply_colors`) based on your design and data structures.

How is camera_to_world_matrix defined?

The `camera_to_world_matrix` function calculates the transformation matrix that converts coordinates from camera space to world space. It takes the camera's position and orientation as input and returns the corresponding transformation matrix. Here's an example of how it might be defined:

```c
t_matrix4 camera_to_world_matrix(const t_camera *camera)
{
    t_matrix4 translation = translation_matrix(camera->position);
    t_matrix4 rotation = rotation_matrix(camera->orientation);
    
    // Combine translation and rotation matrices
    t_matrix4 camera_to_world = multiply_matrices(rotation, translation);
    
    return camera_to_world;
}
```

In this example, we assume the existence of `t_matrix4` structure representing a 4x4 matrix, and `t_camera` structure representing the camera with `position` and `orientation` properties.

The `translation_matrix` and `rotation_matrix` functions create transformation matrices for translation and rotation operations, respectively. You'll need to define these functions based on your chosen conventions for handling transformations.

Here's an example implementation of `translation_matrix`:

```c
t_matrix4 translation_matrix(const t_vector3 translation)
{
    t_matrix4 matrix = {
        {1.0, 0.0, 0.0, translation.x},
        {0.0, 1.0, 0.0, translation.y},
        {0.0, 0.0, 1.0, translation.z},
        {0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0}
    };
    
    return matrix;
}
```

And here's an example implementation of `rotation_matrix`:

```c
t_matrix4 rotation_matrix(const t_vector3 orientation)
{
    // Implementation depends on the chosen representation of rotation (e.g., Euler angles, quaternions)
    // You'll need to convert the orientation to a rotation matrix
    
    // Example code assuming rotation is represented as Euler angles
    double heading = deg_to_rad(orientation.y);
    double pitch = deg_to_rad(orientation.x);
    double roll = deg_to_rad(orientation.z);
    
    t_matrix4 matrix = {
        {cos(heading) * cos(pitch), cos(heading) * sin(pitch) * sin(roll) - sin(heading) * cos(roll), cos(heading) * sin(pitch) * cos(roll) + sin(heading) * sin(roll), 0.0},
        {sin(heading) * cos(pitch), sin(heading) * sin(pitch) * sin(roll) + cos(heading) * cos(roll), sin(heading) * sin(pitch) * cos(roll) - cos(heading) * sin(roll), 0.0},
        {-sin(pitch), cos(pitch) * sin(roll), cos(pitch) * cos(roll), 0.0},
        {0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0}
    };
    
    return matrix;
}
```

Please note that the actual implementation of `rotation_matrix` depends on the chosen representation of rotation (e.g., Euler angles, quaternions, rotation matrices). You'll need to adapt it based on your specific representation.

Remember to include the necessary header files and define any additional helper functions or data structures you need to support these operations.

How is set_pixel_color defined?

The `set_pixel_color` function is responsible for setting the color of a pixel in the image buffer. Here's an example of how it can be defined:

```c
typedef struct s_color
{
    int r;
    int g;
    int b;
}               t_color;

void set_pixel_color(int x, int y, t_color color)
{
    // Assuming the image buffer is a 2D array of colors
    image_buffer[y][x] = color;
}
```

In this example, we assume that `image_buffer` is a 2D array of `t_color` structures representing the image pixels. Each `t_color` structure contains three integer fields: `r` for the red channel, `g` for the green channel, and `b` for the blue channel.

The `set_pixel_color` function takes the pixel coordinates `x` and `y`, as well as the `color` to be set for that pixel. It assigns the `color` to the corresponding position in the image buffer.

Note that the exact implementation of `set_pixel_color` may vary depending on how you manage your image buffer. You may need to consider factors such as the image format (e.g., RGB or RGBA), memory layout, and coordinate system conventions.


What's an optimal way to manage image buffer?

Managing the image buffer efficiently is crucial for performance and memory usage. Here are some considerations for an optimal way to manage the image buffer:

1. **Memory Allocation:** 
   - Allocate memory for the image buffer based on the desired image resolution (width and height).
   - Use a 1D or 2D array to represent the image buffer, depending on your preference and programming style.
   - Consider the memory layout and alignment for efficient access and cache utilization.
   - Allocate the memory in a contiguous block to improve memory locality.

2. **Pixel Format:**
   - Choose an appropriate pixel format based on your requirements and the capabilities of your target platform.
   - Common formats include RGB (24 bits) and RGBA (32 bits), where each color channel is typically represented by 8 bits.
   - Consider the bit ordering (e.g., RGB or BGR) depending on the image library or rendering framework you are using.

3. **Row Stride and Padding:**
   - For a 2D image buffer, consider the row stride, which is the number of bytes between the start of consecutive rows.
   - Padding may be required to align each row to a specific byte boundary for optimal memory access and performance.
   - Calculate the row stride and padding based on the image width, pixel format, and any alignment requirements.

4. **Color Space Conversion:**
   - Depending on the image library or rendering framework you are using, it may require a specific color space, such as sRGB or linear RGB.
   - Consider performing any necessary color space conversions during rendering or when setting pixel colors to ensure correct display or further processing.

5. **Memory Management and Lifespan:**
   - Be mindful of memory management and avoid memory leaks.
   - If the image buffer is used across multiple frames or scenes, consider reusing the same buffer to minimize memory allocations.
   - If the image buffer is short-lived and doesn't need to persist beyond a single frame, allocate and deallocate the buffer as needed.

6. **Parallelization:**
   - If you have multiple threads or processors available, consider parallelizing the rendering process to improve performance.
   - Take care to ensure thread safety and proper synchronization when accessing and modifying the image buffer concurrently.

Remember that the optimal way to manage the image buffer may also depend on the specific requirements and constraints of your project, as well as the tools and libraries you are using. Consider the trade-offs between memory usage, performance, and ease of implementation in order to determine the most suitable approach for your particular use case.

How will rendering work with this implementation of generate_rays?

In the given implementation of `generate_rays`, the rendering process involves shooting rays for each pixel in the image, tracing those rays through the scene, and setting the resulting pixel color in the image buffer. Here's an overview of how rendering works with this implementation:

1. **Ray Generation:**
   - The `generate_rays` function generates a primary ray for each pixel in the image.
   - It calculates the ray's origin at the camera position and the ray's direction based on the pixel's position and the camera's field of view.
   - The generated rays represent the viewpoint from the camera through each pixel in the image.

2. **Ray Tracing:**
   - For each generated ray, we perform ray tracing to determine the color of the corresponding pixel.
   - The generated ray is passed to the `trace_ray` function, along with the scene objects and lights.
   - The `trace_ray` function handles the intersection calculations and shading to determine the final color of the ray.
   - Depending on the intersection results, the `trace_ray` function may also recursively generate additional rays for reflections or refractions.

3. **Pixel Color Calculation:**
   - After the `trace_ray` function returns the color for a specific ray, the `set_pixel_color` function is called to set the corresponding pixel color in the image buffer.
   - The `set_pixel_color` function takes the pixel coordinates and the calculated color as input.
   - It assigns the color to the corresponding position in the image buffer, effectively updating the pixel color for that specific ray.

4. **Looping Through All Pixels:**
   - The `generate_rays` function contains nested loops that iterate over all pixels in the image.
   - For each pixel, a ray is generated, and ray tracing is performed to determine the pixel color.
   - The calculated pixel color is then set in the image buffer using the `set_pixel_color` function.
   - The loops continue until all pixels in the image have been processed.

5. **Completion of Rendering:**
   - Once all rays have been generated, traced, and their resulting pixel colors set in the image buffer, the rendering process is complete.
   - The resulting image buffer contains the color information for each pixel, representing the rendered scene.

It's important to note that this is a simplified overview, and the exact details of the ray tracing algorithm, intersection calculations, shading, and recursive ray generation will depend on your specific implementation. Additionally, you may need to consider optimizations and techniques such as anti-aliasing, spatial data structures (e.g., bounding volume hierarchies), and parallelization to enhance the efficiency and visual quality of the rendering process.
